# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor Algorithms

## Project Overview
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. Using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, i have created a model to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. In this project i have used the following two machine learning algorithms for fraud detection:
### 1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
### 2. Isolation Forest Algorithm

Furthermore, i have evaluated the metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores to find the classification accuracy. 

In addition, i have explored the data and created visualizations such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data.
